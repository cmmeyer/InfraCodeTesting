# Cloud Infrastructure Testing in CI/CD Pipelines

This is my first attempt building a presentation in markdown using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) and [remarker](https://github.com/kt3k/remarker).

To build it, you'll need remarker installed (`sudo npm i -g remarker`)
To present from the server, run `npx remarker` from this directory.
